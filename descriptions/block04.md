Quantum teleportation transmits an unknown qubit |ψ⟩ (on qubit 0) to qubit 2 using 
an entangled pair (qubit 1 & qubit 2).  
1) Create Bell pair on (1,2): H(1) → CNOT(1,2).  
2) Bell‐state measurement on (0,1) via CNOT(0,1) and H(0).  
3) Measure qubits 0 and 1.  
4) (In hardware) Apply corrections on qubit 2 based on classical outcomes.  
The state |ψ⟩ originally on qubit 0 reappears on qubit 2.
